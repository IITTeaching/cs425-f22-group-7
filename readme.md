===========================<br />

<p>This is our final project for CS425 Database Organization. In this project we sought to create a primative functional banking system utilizing postgresql and a java application. After designing and implementing a SQL database schema this application has been developed to allow a user to log in to different accounts at a theoretical bank, supported on the back end by our database, and create and execute transactions.</p>

<p>===========================</p>
<h6>Available Tools:</h6>
<p>In this program, the following functions are available depending on the account you are logged in as:</p>
<p>Withdrawl - allows a user to withdrawl funds from an account. If logged in as a customer, you should not be allowed to withdrawl from accounts you do not own.</p>
<p>Deposit - allows a user to deposit funds into an account. Deposits may be done by any user, but a customer should not have access to accounts they dont own</p>
<p>Transfer - allows the transfer of funds between accounts. Customers may not transfer from accounts they do not own, but may transfer to whomever they wish. Tellers and Managers do not have this restriction.</p>
<p>Check Balance - allows a user to print out the current balance in an account. All users may do this, but customers may only do it for their owned accounts.</p>
<p>Transactions - allows a user to print out a list of recent transactions, withdrawls, or deposits made on an account. Customers may only do this on owned accounts.</p>
<p>Switch Account - allows a user to change the account they are viewing the system from the perspective of.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additional functionalities such as logging out are supported.</p>
